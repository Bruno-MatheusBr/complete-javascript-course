* Varibles only can have letters, numbers, underscore and dollar sign.
* Don't use "name" as a verible
* Use upper case to name constant that never changes like "PI = 3.1415"
* Const cannot be redeclared
* Const cannot be set undefined. It always has to set a value
* Var works some way like Let. It can be redeclared
* Declaring a varible is not mandatory, but never do that.

# Type Coercion
* Plus sign changes numbers into a string
* -, * and / will change strings into a number
